# OEM MAP Sensors

### Introduction

If your anything like me and you have researched information about OEM Map sensors you will find conflicting, false data sprawled allover the net. This spread sheet is being put together as a means of having all the OEM Map sensor data in one place that is measured under the same conditions therefore comparable accurate data can be obtained and used for comparison, map sensor selection and calibration.

A special test bed has been built that will be used for all MAP testing. 


This information is a *work in progress*, as new sensors are located, tested and verified the data will be added here.


If you would like to donate MAP sensors for testing. Please contact any FreeEMS Forum [Moderator](http://forum.diyefi.org/index.php) at freeems.org

### Goals

Gain/compare a broad range of OEM Map Sensor data for project integration.

The **todo** list will be updated as changes/updates come to mind.

Enjoy.
Preston.
